                    The Three Princes of Serendip <br>
                    <br>
                    ”In ancient times there existed in the country of Serendippo, in the Far East, a great and powerful
                    king by the name of Giaffer. He had three sons who were very dear to him. And being a good father
                    and very concerned about their education, he decided that he had to leave them endowed not only with
                    great power, but also with all kinds of virtues of which princes are particularly in need.”
                    So begins the fascinating story of The Three Princes of Serendip. In order to provide the best
                    tutors for his sons, the king travels throughout the island until he finds a number of scholars,
                    each specialized in a different field, “And to them he entrusted the training of his sons, with the
                    understanding that the best they could do for him was to teach them in such a way that they could be
                    immediately recognized as his very own.” <br>
                    <br>
                    As the three princes are endowed with great intelligence, they soon become highly trained in the
                    arts and sciences. However, when the tutors inform the king of his sons’ achievements, he is
                    sceptical. So he summons his eldest son and announces that he wishes to retire to a monastery and
                    that his son should succeed him as ruler. The eldest son politely refuses, insisting that his father
                    is wiser and should reign until his death. The two younger sons also refuse when commanded in a
                    similar manner.” <br>
                    <br>
                    Although the king is astonished by the wisdom displayed by his sons, he decides to send them on a
                    prolonged journey so that they can acquire empirical experience. He summons his sons and, giving the
                    impression of being angry and disappointed because they have all disobeyed him, banishes them from
                    Serendip. “Thus they started their peregrination and moved out of his kingdom until they reached the
                    kingdom of a great and powerful emperor, whose name was Beramo.”
                    Misfortune befalls the princes when a camel driver stops them on the road and asks them if they have
                    seen one of his camels. Although they have not, they have noticed signs that suggest a camel has
                    passed along the road. Ever ready to dazzle with their wit and sagacity, the princes mystify the
                    camel driver by asking him if the lost camel is blind in one eye, missing a tooth and lame. The
                    camel driver, impressed by the accuracy of the description, immediately hurries off in pursuit of
                    the animal. <br>
                    <br>
                    After a fruitless search, and feeling deceived, he returns to the princes, who reassure him by
                    supplying further information. The camel, they say, carried a load of butter on one side and honey
                    on the other, and was ridden by a pregnant woman. Concluding that the princes have stolen the camel,
                    the driver has them imprisoned. It is only after the driver’s neighbour finds the camel that they
                    are released. <br>
                    <br>
                    The princes are brought before Emperor Beramo, who asks them how they could give such an accurate
                    description of a camel they had never seen. It is clear from the princes’ reply that they had
                    brilliantly interpreted the scant evidence observed along the road.
                    As the grass had been eaten on one side of the road where it was less verdant, the princes deduced
                    that the camel was blind to the other side. Because there were lumps of chewed grass on the road the
                    size of a camel’s tooth, presumably they had fallen through the gap left by a missing tooth. The
                    tracks showed the prints of only three feet, the fourth being dragged, indicating that the animal
                    was lame. That butter was carried on one side of the camel and honey on the other was clear because
                    ants had been attracted to melted butter on one side of the road and flies to spilled honey on the
                    other.
